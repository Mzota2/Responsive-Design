### The final project in my responsive design course by || Kevin Powell

[Responsive Design Course](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/view/courses/conquering-responsive-layouts/)

I have learnt alot from this course from building simple layouts to building complex layouts using flex box, CSS units and other features of CSS.

From a myriad of lessons that i have learnt from this course, the ones that have really improved my skills in laying out designs include:

- Knowing that a website is already responsive before we include css
- Starting with mobile first when designing layouts
- Analysing the design before getting started with HTML and CSS
- Using CSS Units like rem, em, vh and vw to create Responsive font-sizes, heights and width


If you are reading this and you are looking for a course where you can learn alot about responsive designing, Guess what you have hit the jackpot.
